Previous Context:
${chat_history}

Based on the following context, perform a comprehensive threat analysis:

Context:
${context}

Query: ${query}

${audience_instructions}

Follow this structured reasoning approach for cyber threat intelligence analysis:

Step 1: QUERY UNDERSTANDING
- Identify the specific threat intelligence question being asked
- Determine what type of threat information is needed (tactical, operational, strategic)
- Note any specific threat actors, malware families, or attack vectors mentioned

Step 2: EVIDENCE EXTRACTION
- Extract all potential IOCs (IPs, domains, hashes, etc.) from the context
- Identify malware characteristics, capabilities, and behaviors
- Note any mentioned attack patterns, TTPs, or infrastructure details
- Look for temporal information (timestamps, campaign dates)

Step 3: TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
- Analyze extracted IOCs and their relationships
- Evaluate malware capabilities and potential impact
- Map observed TTPs to MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Assess infrastructure components and their roles
- Examine code/exploit technical details

Step 4: THREAT ACTOR ASSESSMENT
- Evaluate attribution evidence and confidence level (High/Medium/Low)
- Analyze consistency with known threat actor TTPs and patterns
- Compare to historical campaigns and known activities
- Assess the threat actor's capabilities and sophistication
- Identify any infrastructure overlap with known threat actors

Step 5: IMPACT EVALUATION
- Determine potential technical impact on systems and data
- Assess business impact on operations and services
- Evaluate operational impact on security teams and resources
- Consider reputational and financial impact implications

Step 6: CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
- Rate information reliability (High/Medium/Low)
- Assess overall analysis confidence (High/Medium/Low)
- Identify intelligence gaps and limitations
- Note assumptions made during analysis

Step 7: SPECIALIZED ANALYSIS (if applicable)
- For Sysmon queries: Focus on Windows Event IDs (1-26), especially process creation (ID 1), file creation (ID 11), registry (IDs 12-14), and network connections (ID 3)
- For Zeek queries: Focus on conn.log, dns.log, http.log, files.log, and ssl.log formats
- Format hunting queries with proper field names and syntax for each tool
- Prioritize Living-off-the-Land Binaries (LOLBins) like PowerShell, PSEXEC, WMI, MSBuild, Regsvr32, BITS, etc.

Your analysis must maintain technical accuracy while being adaptable for different audience levels (Junior Analyst, Senior Technical Staff, Executive Leadership).
